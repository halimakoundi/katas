/*
Write a program to score a game of Ten-Pin Bowling.
Input: string (described below) representing a bowling game
Ouput: integer score
The scoring rules:
Each game, or "line" of bowling, includes ten turns, or "frames" for the bowler. 
In each frame, the bowler gets up to two tries to knock down all ten pins. 

/* Points allocation for strike */
If the first ball in a frame knocks down all ten pins, this is called a "strike". The frame is over. 
The score for the frame is ten plus the total of the pins knocked down in the next two balls. 

/* Points allocation for spare */
If the second ball in a frame knocks down all ten pins, this is called a "spare". The frame is over. 
The score for the frame is ten plus the number of pins knocked down in the next ball. 

/* Points allocation for other scenario */
If, after both balls, there is still at least one of the ten pins standing 
the score for that frame is simply the total number of pins knocked down in those two balls.

/* Bonus balls */
If you get a spare in the last (10th) frame you get one more bonus ball. 
If you get a strike in the last (10th) frame you get two more bonus balls.
These bonus throws are taken as part of the same turn. If a bonus ball knocks down all the pins, the process does not repeat. 
The bonus balls are only used to calculate the score of the final frame.
The game score is the total of all frame scores.

Examples:
X indicates a strike
/ indicates a spare
- indicates a miss
| indicates a frame boundary
The characters after the || indicate bonus balls

X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X||XX
Ten strikes on the first ball of all ten frames.
Two bonus balls, both strikes.
Score for each frame == 10 + score for next two 
balls == 10 + 10 + 10 == 30
Total score == 10 frames x 30 == 300

9-|9-|9-|9-|9-|9-|9-|9-|9-|9-||
Nine pins hit on the first ball of all ten frames.
Second ball of each frame misses last remaining pin.
No bonus balls.
Score for each frame == 9
Total score == 10 frames x 9 == 90

5/|5/|5/|5/|5/|5/|5/|5/|5/|5/||5
Five pins on the first ball of all ten frames.
Second ball of each frame hits all five remaining
pins, a spare.
One bonus ball, hits five pins.
Score for each frame == 10 + score for next one
ball == 10 + 5 == 15
Total score == 10 frames x 15 == 150

X|7/|9-|X|-8|8/|-6|X|X|X||81
Frame1 : X|7/ = 27 -> 20
Frame2 : 7/|9 = 19 -> 39
Frame3 : 9- = 9 -> 48
Frame4 : X|-8 = 18 -> 66
Frame5 : -8 = 8 -> 74
Frame6 : 8/|- = 10 -> 84
Frame7 : -6 = 6 -> 90
Frame8 : X|X|X = 30 -> 120
Frame9 : X|X||8 = 28 -> 148
Frame10 : X||81 = 19 -> 167

Total score == 167
